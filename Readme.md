Distance Matrix
===============

This is a simple web-based app based on the Google Maps JavaScript API for computing the distance matrix between multiple points of
interest.

I created to help pick a place to live by generating personalized walk (and bike/drive/transit) scores for various
apartments to places I wanted to go.

Also a technical experiment with node.js, gulp, browserify, and google apis.
